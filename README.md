# Web Audio API workshop materials

This is the collection of all the materials used during the "Internet Music - An introduction to the Web Audio API" workshop.

The workshop is directed at people with no previous experience (or just a little experience) with coding, but curious about making sounds and music in the browser.

Included are
* Basic examples to get started with the Web Audio API (in order of difficulty)
* Examples of more complex musical implementations (such as filters, effects, live input, white noise...)
* Code snippets for including basic UI elements and interactions to your web based musical instrument
* Introduction examples to the http://theresassoundworld.com/ framework

It is a work in progress and more stuff will be added soon.

Enjoy!
